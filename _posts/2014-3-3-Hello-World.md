What makes an explanation a good explanation?
In DCSI 542 Communication and Argumentation class we discussed tow different types of explanation; top-down and bottom-up explanations. These are basic properties of these explanations.
Top down :
According to these approach, the aouthor starts explanation with a definition of the problem and continue with stating conditions and requirements of the problem. After these detailed definition, the author gives examples to support and clarify the definiton.

Bottom up :
Bottom-down approach on the other hand, starts with an example or an analogy to warm up the audience and attract them to complete the reading. After giving example, the author states the definition and conditions.
