What makes an explanation a good explanation?

In DCSI 542 Communication and Argumentation class we discussed two different types of explanation; top-down and bottom-up explanations. These are basic properties of these explanations.

Top down :

According to these approach, the aouthor starts explanation with a definition of a problem and continue with stating conditions and requirements of this problem. After these detailed definitions, the author gives examples to support and clarify his ideas.

Bottom up :

Bottom-up approach on the other hand, starts with an example or an analogy to warm up the audience and attract them to complete the reading. After giving examples, the author states the definition and conditions.
